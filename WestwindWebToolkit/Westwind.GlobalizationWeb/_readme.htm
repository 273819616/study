            Localization Samples Configuration</h1>
		<a href="default.aspx">Home</a><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<blockquote> In order to run these demos you need the following:<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>ASP.NET 3.5 or later<li>Sql Server 2008/2005 or Express, MSDE, SQL Server 2000
			</ul>
            <h3>
				<span style="color: blue;
                    font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-no-proof: yes"><br />
                </span>&nbsp;</h3>
			<H3>Database</H3>
			<p>
				The Sample database is provided as &quot;DevSamples&quot; and needs to be installed from 
                installation root by executing the DevSamplesData_RunThis_ToInstallDb.exe. This 
                package installs the database in Sql Server 2008/2005 or Express versions on 
                your machine.
				The database contains a <i>Localizations </i>table which contains the 
                localization resources for this sample application.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>IMPORTANT!<br />
                </strong>The sample ships with the data base provider enabled. If for whatever 
                reason your database connection does not work properly all resources will fail. 
                Make sure the database connectivity works first or localization will not work. 
                If you have problems with localization you can also turn off the resource 
                provider in the web.config file and go back to the stock Resx Resources (comment 
                the &lt;globalization&gt; section in the web.config). Once the localization admin form 
                works you can re-enable the database resource provider.</p>
            <h3>
                Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                The resource provider in the sample is configured to use the 
                DevSamples database by default and it uses <?xml:namespace 
  prefix = o />
                                    the localization data found there. The DbResource configuration section includes
                a connection string and tablename for the database which you can override if you're
                not using Sql Express.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Connection String</strong></p>
            <p>
                For the connection string in DbResourceProvider you can use either a full connection
                string or the name of a 'ConnectionStrings' entry in web.config. The easiest way
                to configure your database connection string is just to set up the <strong>
                DevSampleConnectionString</strong>
                Connection string. This connection string is used both by the samples as well as
                the provider by default.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Creating a new Localization Resource Table</strong></p>
            <p>
                Obviously you can store the globalization data in any database so you can point
                it at any connection string of your choice. Note that the Admin interface can automatically
                create a new Localization table for you. To do this set your connectionString to
                the database of your choice and set the resourceTableName to the name of your choice.
                Run the admin form (LocalizationAdmin/LocalizeForm.aspx) - and you should get a
                notice that the table can not be found. Click on Create Table on the toolbar on
                the left to create the new table. Note whatever account you connect
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Resource Provider Configuration</strong></p>
            <p>
                In addition the wwDbResourceProvider section contains other settings to configure the provider's execution environment. You can find more information on these settings
                in the help file.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Enabling the Resource Provider</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                To use the wwDbresourceProvider or wwDbSimpleResourceProvider you need to also enable
                the resource provider in ASP.NET in the <strong>&lt;globalization&gt;</strong> section. This Web.config is configured to use the wwDbSimpleResourceProvider and you can check the commented
                sections to see how the providers are hooked up.</p>
            <h3>
                File Requirements to run the ResourceProvider and Admin Interface</h3>
            <p>
                The resource provider can import and export Resx resources. In order to export 
                resources the application must have WRITE access in the application folder. This 
                means the application user account (NETWORK SERVICE or ASPNET) typically must be 
                set to have Read/Write or Full access in the application&#39;s folders. This is only 
                required if you want to export to Resx resources.</p>
            <h3>
                Security</h3>
            <p>
                The provider related code can run in Medium trust. The administration form too 
                can run in medium trust but the Translation features require that Google.com and 
                Babelfish.com are accessible.</p>
            <pre>            &lt;trust level="Medium" originUrl="(http://www.google.com/translate_t)|(http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_txt)"/&gt;</pre>
