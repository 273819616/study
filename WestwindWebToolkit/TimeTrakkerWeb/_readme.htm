<h1>Time Trakker Sample Configuration</h1>

<div style="margin: 20px;">


    <p>
    This sample is a demonstration of using LINQ to SQL through a business layer. In 
    this application all data access occurs through business components which derive
    from the wwBusinessObject base class.
        <br />
        <br />This sample consists of 3 projects:<br />
        <ul>
        <li> TimeTrakkerWeb - The Web/UI front end project<br />
        <li> TimeTrakkerBusiness - application specific business objects<br />
        <li> Westwind.BusinessFramework - a simple business object wrapper for LINQ to SQL<br />
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br /><b>Web Configuration</b><br />The sample is set up to run as a virtual under
        <a href="http://localhost/TimeTrakkerWeb/">http://localhost/TimeTrakkerWeb/</a> 
    rather than with the local Web server, due to an odd configuration issue that 
    causes file paths not to be resolved properly by the Visual Studio Web Server.&nbsp;If you have to use Visual Studio Web Server note that styles 
    and images won&#39;t load until you login (top right).<br />
    <br />
    To configure IIS go into the Web Project properties and use the Create Virtual 
    Directory option assuming you have IIS installed on your machine.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Database Setup<br /></b>The sample is set up to run against the 
    TimeTrakker database stored in the App_Data directory. By default the app points 
    to SQL Express as a file resource. You can change the ConnectionString in 
    web.config to a full SQL server instance by adjusting the name of one of the 
    alternate entries. <br />
    <br />
    <b>User Setup and Sample Default Login</b><br />
    The sample uses a user table (Users) in the SQL database to validate users. The 
    default user info is:<br />
    <br />
    Username:<br />
    <a href="mailto:rstrahl@west-wind.com">rstrahl@west-wind.com</a><br />
    <br />
    Password:<br />
    ww<br />
    <br />
    If you want to play around with the sample 
    data you should log in with this account. To add a new user manually just add a 
    new record to the Users table in the database - there&#39;s currently no UI to do this through code.</p>
